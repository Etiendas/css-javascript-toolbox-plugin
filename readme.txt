Q: Can I move the blocks around?
	A: Yes by hovering your mouse cursor over the code block title bar until it turns into a four-sided arrow, 
	this allow you to move the blocks. Clicking the block title bar allows you to open and close the blocks.

Q: I'm using the URL List and my code is not working?
	A: Make sure you have copied and pasted the page, post, or category URL exactly as it appears in the address bar. 
	For example, you may have inadvertently included an extra forward slash at the end of your URL.
	
Q: Where did my CSS & JavaScript Block I created go?
	A: If you have added a new CSS/JS block, created a title and clicked the Save All Changes button, 
	and you refreshed the page when your block did not contain any code, then when the page reloads, 
	your new 'empty' block will disappear. You must have code inside the block for it to permanently save.

Q: Why use the Footer switch in Location/Hook?
	A: Hook location feature gives you control over the location of outputting the CSS/JS code. 
	This is useful in case overriding another Plugin CSS is required. Also sometimes its better to put your JS code 
	in the footer to avoid slowing down your page load.

Q: I received a weird error, what do I do now?
	A: Sometimes a bug decides to rear its ugly head and when this happens, this is when we need your help. 
	If you receive an error, if it be a PHP error, or some functionality that isn't working for whatever reason, 
	please send us an email.
